                    <h1>Transcritique - Bakunin and Marx</h1>
                    <p>
                        Let's transcritique Bakunin and Marx! As premise, the
                        transcritique means philosophical approach produced by
                        Kojin Karatani that method uses each to critique the
                        other. Bakunin and Marx, they are often seen as opposing
                        axis like a strife in the First International but I
                        wanna integrate them because I think they have common
                        points.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I try to critique Marx from perspective of Bakunin,
                        Marx's strategy is authoritarian and centralized and he
                        ignores people's spontaneity. However, I try to critique
                        Bakunin from perspective of Marx, his theory is ethical
                        but rough because it's not based on historical
                        materialism and condition of the relations of
                        production.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It does not mean that all Marxists is enemy of
                        anarchist. Take for example, the Libertarian Marxism is
                        libertarian(anti-authoritarian) interpret of Marxism.
                        They importance role of individual free will in
                        historical materialism and understand proletarian
                        dictatorship as bottom up democratic power by the
                        people, so not always conflict with anarchism.

                    <h1>Bakuningrad the dream city</h1>
                    <p>
                        My birthplace, the Bakuningrad is a den of we
                        Bakunin-ists. That exists at cities that's took hegemony
                        by us! We have to understand that city is "imagined
                        community" too because historically, rulers of the city
                        gave that, a name they want and make people call the
                        name.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And conversely, we can create imagined community
                        consciously, and take hegemony (context like a theory of
                        Antonio Gramsci). If we success to take hegemony, It's
                        allowed to famous cities such as Tokyo, New York or
                        Moscow, called "Bakuningrad" like we want! Let's go to
                        battlefield of ideological struggle, and its war of
                        position!

                    <h1>What's next era of the MODERN?</h1>
                    <p>
                        The surmount of modern, that is difficult main theme of
                        my and many orthodox socialists' thoughts. I can say
                        modern is progressive and free era by comparison with
                        medieval feudalism or ancient empire, but we shall not
                        stop at modern. We have to defeat national-state,
                        capitalism and patriarchy, these social structure that
                        let people be alienation. Karl Marx images "Free
                        association of producers" that will be alternative while
                        critique of capitalism. I very agree that clear vision.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But I think political revolution and proletarian
                        dictatorship is too authoritarian strategy. In fact,
                        Soviet-Russia that's born by people's spontaneity but
                        corrupt to state-capitalism with Bolsheviks. I'm
                        oriented to economical revolution like Proudhon. I think
                        the economical revolution needs decentralized technical
                        methods like a P2P I'm working, to reform means of
                        production and to establish a new society that's based
                        on mutual aid by free will of each individuals.

                        I created propaganda poster that imitate Russian

                        avant-garde arts is daring color usage and powerful
                        composition. I love it and try to learn from it to
                        create my poster.

                                clearly to say traditional allelomorphism of
                                between Anarchists and Bolsheviks. Left light
                                and yellow screen shows libertarian people who
                                are demonstrating their principles on the
                                streets. Right dark and red screen shows
                                authoritarian, USSR soldiers who have flags of
                                Lenin. And thick and black framework that splits
