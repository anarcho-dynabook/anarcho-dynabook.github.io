                <h1>Transcritique - Bakunin and Marx</h1>
                <p>
                    Let's transcritique Bakunin and Marx! As premise, the
                    transcritique means philosophical approach produced by Kojin
                    Karatani that method uses each to critique the other.
                    Bakunin and Marx, they are often seen as opposing axis like
                    a strife in the First International but I wanna integrate
                    them because I think they have common points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I try to critique Marx from perspective of Bakunin, Marx's
                    strategy is authoritarian and centralized and he ignores
                    people's spontaneity. However, I try to critique Bakunin
                    from perspective of Marx, his theory is ethical but rough
                    because it's not based on historical materialism and
                    condition of the relations of production.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It does not mean that all Marxists is enemy of anarchist.
                    Take for example, the Libertarian Marxism is
                    libertarian(anti-authoritarian) interpret of Marxism. They
                    importance role of individual free will in historical
                    materialism and understand proletarian dictatorship as
                    bottom up democratic power by the people, so not always
                    conflict with anarchism.

                <h1>Bakuningrad the dream city</h1>
                <p>
                    My birthplace, the Bakuningrad is a den of we Bakunin-ists.
                    That exists at cities that's took hegemony by us! We have to
                    understand that city is "imagined community" too because
                    historically, rulers of the city gave that, a name they want
                    and make people call the name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And conversely, we can create imagined community
                    consciously, and take hegemony (context like a theory of
                    Antonio Gramsci). If we success to take hegemony, It's
                    allowed to famous cities such as Tokyo, New York or Moscow,
                    called "Bakuningrad" like we want! Let's go to battlefield
                    of ideological struggle, and its war of position!

                <h1>What's next era of the MODERN?</h1>
                <p>
                    The surmount of modern, that is difficult main theme of my
                    and many orthodox socialists' thoughts. I can say modern is
                    progressive and free era by comparison with medieval
                    feudalism or ancient empire, but we shall not stop at
                    modern. We have to defeat national-state, capitalism and
                    patriarchy, these social structure that let people be
                    alienation. Karl Marx images "Free association of producers"
                    that will be alternative while critique of capitalism. I
                    very agree that clear vision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I think political revolution and proletarian
                    dictatorship is too authoritarian strategy. In fact,
                    Soviet-Russia that's born by people's spontaneity but
                    corrupt to state-capitalism with Bolsheviks. I'm oriented to
                    economical revolution like Proudhon. I think the economical
                    revolution needs decentralized technical methods like a P2P
                    I'm working, to reform means of production and to establish
                    a new society that's based on mutual aid by free will of
                    each individuals.

                <h1>The practice of design Russian avant-garde arts</h1>
                <p>
                    I created propaganda poster that imitate Russian avant-garde
                    technique and methods. The fascinating points of Russian
                    avant-garde arts is daring color usage and powerful
                    composition. I love it and try to learn from it with
                    respect.

                <p>
                    This poster contrasts Libertarian vs Authoritarian in the
                    leftist movement, or clearly to say traditional opposing
                    axis of between Anarchists and Bolsheviks. Left light and
                    yellow screen shows libertarian people who are demonstrating
                    their anarchism principles on the streets. Right dark and
                    red screen shows authoritarian socialists, USSR soldiers who
                    have flags of Lenin. And thick and black steel framework
                    that splits up these screen give this poster by and large
                    vigor impression.

                    I will write a new designed browser engine that's
